KNOWN BUGS (miniAudicle-0.2.2c (gidora))
----------------------------------------

- miniAudicle will not run on Linux with wxWidgets 2.8 or higher and GTK 2.8 or 
  lower.  The only solution at this point is to use wxWidgets 2.6 or GTK 2.10.  
  wxWidgets 2.8 and 2.6 can coexist on the same installation without interfering
  with each other; to compile miniAudicle using wx 2.6 on a system that has 2.6
  and 2.8, enter the following command (in bash) before running make:
  
      export WX_OPTIONS="--version=2.6"
      
  For systems with GTK 2.10, miniAudicle will run with either wxWidgets 2.6 or 
  2.8.  

- On Windows Vista, miniAudicle must be run in Windows XP emulation mode.

- console output causes general performance degradation over time on OS X.  If
  you right-click the console monitor, an option to "Clear Buffer" will appear,
  which will speed things up again.  

- until chuck garbage collection is in place, MAUI windows don't self-destruct
  when associated shred is removed from the VM

- MAUI_elements not yet available from the command line chuck, which will 
  hopefully change in the near future

- MAUI elements not available in Win32/Linux

- auto-indentation still has a few problems on all platforms

If you have any bugs to report, please send a stack trace, the output of the
console monitor, the output of chuck --probe, and a description of the bug to
ssalazar@cs.princeton.edu, or chuck-users@lists.cs.princeton.edu.
