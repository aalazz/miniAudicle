KNOWN BUGS | miniAudicle-1.5.x (latte)
--------------------------------------
- on certain systems, console output may cause general performance
  degradation over time on macOS. If you right-click the console monitor,
  an option to "Clear Buffer" will appear, which will speed things up
  again.

- auto-indentation still has a few problems on all platforms

- MAUI (miniAudicle UI) elements not available in Win32/Linux

- until chuck garbage collection is in place, MAUI windows don't
  self-destruct when associated shred is removed from the VM
